							My debut album, "Don't Worry", has been released. You can now stream or buy it on Bandcamp, or stream it on SoundCloud. I've been working on this album
							for about 5 months. Many hours were spent simply thinking of where to take the music and what kind of writing styles should be included. "Don't Worry"
							comes from a very personal place within me. Listen to the subtle guitar plucks and explosive verse transitions to get an idea of the contrast between
							what someone thinks versus what they do. I suppose this could be categorized as a concept album, but I'll leave that up to you.
